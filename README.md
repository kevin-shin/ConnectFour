# ConnectFour

ConnectFour.java is a program which executes a game of Connect Four between two players through the console. Users are prompted to type in the column number to which they would like to place their piece, and the turns alternate until a player wins, or a stalemate happens.

The program is set up so that, by default, the program starts with player RED. Further, at the end of each game, the users are prompted to choose whether to start a new round.

INSTRUCTIONS: Users should run the main method by any IDE of their choice, or compiling the file through the Terminal. No additional packages or libraries are required.
